    "**Task 2: Dictionary Lookup**\n",
    "Write a Python program that simulates a simple dictionary for translating `English words to Spanish`. Define a dictionary containing a few English words as `keys` and their corresponding Spanish translations as `values`. Allow `users to enter` an English word, and then display its Spanish translation `if it exists` in the dictionary.(use google for English to Spanish translator)\n",

    "**Task 4: Contact List**\n",
    "Build a basic contact list using a dictionary. Initially, the dictionary can be `empty`. Allow users to `add new contacts` with `names and phone numbers`. Users should also be able to search for contacts by name and display their phone numbers(use in operator).\n",

    "**Task 5: Dictionary Iteration**\n",
    "Write a Python program that defines a dictionary containing the names of `fruits as keys` and their corresponding `colors as values` (e.g., 'apple': 'red').Do atleast 5 dictionary methods on it.\n"

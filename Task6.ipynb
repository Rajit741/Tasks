    "**Assignment Task 1:** Tuple Basics\n",
    "Create a Python tuple containing the names of your favorite fruits. Write a Python program to print `each fruit` name from the tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 2:** Tuple Operations\n",
    "Given two tuples, write a Python program to `concatenate` them into a `single` tuple and then find the `length` of the resulting tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 3:** Set Creation\n",
    "Create a Python set containing the first 10 `even` numbers (2, 4, 6, ...). Write a program to `display` this set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 4:** Set Operations\n",
    "Given two sets, write a Python program to find the `union, intersection, and difference` of these sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 5:** Tuple and Set Conversion\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a `tuple` of integers and converts it into a `set`. Then, find and print the `maximum and minimum` values from the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 6:** Tuple Immutability\n",
    "Explain the concept of immutability in Python tuples with examples. Discuss why tuples are considered immutable data structures.\n",

    "**Assignment Task 7:** Set Operations and Methods\n",
    "Write a Python program that takes a set of numbers and performs the following operations:\n",
    "   - Add a new number to the set.\n",
    "   - Remove a number from the set.\n",
    "   - Check if a specific number is in the set.\n",
    "   - Find the size of the set.\n",

    "Given a tuple of 10 elements, write a Python program to print the elements from the `3rd to the 7th `position using slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 9:** Set Operations with Lists\n",
    "Create a Python list with duplicate elements and convert it into a set to remove duplicates. Then, write a program to count how many duplicates were removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assignment Task 10:** Tuple and Set Combinations\n",
    "Create a `tuple` containing the names of your friend's favorite movies and a `set` containing the names of your favorite movies. Write a Python program to find and display common elements (movies that feature your "
